# indexhelper

It is the year 2015 and still computers are mainly used by humans to chit chat, make selfies and create Power Point presentations. Yet, the power of automation has not been fully exploited yet and there's still highly educated people wasting their time copying and pasting words around in their academic texts.

**Indexing should be easy and fun!**

This Python script is intended to eat all your written words and spit out the most common unique words in your text minus common English language words. Alphabetically.

**That almost sounds like an index, doesn't it?**

The human can then use this raw information, paste it into their favourite Word document and start from there.

**Usage:**

1. Create a .txt document of your writing
2. Open the terminal, navigate to the `indexhelper` folder and run something like
```
python indexer.py <yourFile> <stopWords> >out.txt
If no arguments are given files/sample.txt and stop_words.txt will be used as default files
```
The file `out.txt` contains the desired list of words + count.

Note: The file `all_indexer.py` works exactly the same, however puts all words, down to occurence of 1 in the output.

Enjoy!!!

**Example Output**
Have a look at the example folder for example file outputs, e.g. an idex of the GNU license.


**Future improvements will include**

* Some sort of usabilty for non CLI friends
* support for writer's favourite file fomats (.docx, .odt...)
* Page numbers included for a selected set of key words to generate a final index
* Multiple language support (per request)
* A pony
